    "# Classes \n",
    "In Python, classes are like blueprints for creating objects. Imagine you want to make toy cars. The class is the plan that tells you how to build a toy car. Each toy car you make using this plan is an object. The class defines what the toy car (object) can do and what it knows, like its color or speed. So, a class is like a template for creating things with specific properties and behaviors.\n"
